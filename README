Questions

1. Ask for the user's name and output it in ALL UPPERCASE.
2. Ask for a user's full name and output it with the first letter of each name capitalized: (ex: "john f kenney" -> "John F Kennedy")
3. Ask the user for a sentence and translate it in to Pig Latin: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin)
4. Ask the user for a sentence and output all the palindromes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)
5. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.
		For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
6. Given a string with some readable English text in it, reverse it without changing the order of the letters within the words themselves. 
		Example: "I'm getting a new pooper-scooper. Yay!" becomes "!Yay .scooper-pooper new a getting I'm"
7. Given x1,y1,width1,height1 and x2,y2,width2,height2 that each represent a rectangle, determine if they overlap.
8. Write the a program that calculates the smaller angle (in degrees) between the minute hand and hour hand in an analog clock.
        The hour will be specified as an integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive) and minute will be specified as an integer between 0 and 59 (inclusive)
9. You are given two text files, index_file.txt and data_file.txt. data_file.txt is a large file containing a lot of words.
	index_file.txt contains space separated tokens, each of which is of the format: lineNumber:wordNumber. Your task 
	is to translate the tokens in the index_file.txt to their corresponding words from data_file.txt. The best solution
	minimizes memory usage and avoids needing the entire data_file.txt to be read in to memory.
10. Start with two arrays of strings, a and b, each in alphabetical order, possibly with duplicates. 
	Return the count of the number of strings which appear in both arrays. The best "linear" solution makes a 
	single pass over both arrays, taking advantage of the fact that they are in alphabetical order. 
	
	commonTwo({"a", "c", "x"}, {"b", "c", "d", "x"}) → 2
	commonTwo({"a", "c", "x"}, {"a", "b", "c", "x", "z"}) → 3
	commonTwo({"a", "c", "x"}, {"b", "e", "z", "z", "z"}) → 0
	commonTwo({"a", "b", "c"}, {"a", "b", "c"}) → 3
11. Given a non-negative int n, return the sum of its digits recursively (no loops). Note that mod (%) by 10 
	yields the rightmost digit (126 % 10 is 6), while divide (/) by 10 removes the rightmost digit (126 / 10 is 12).
	
	sumDigits(126) → 9
	sumDigits(49) → 13
	sumDigits(12) → 3
12. Download this file and save it as a sample_data.json. 
	https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4mGtcW98BshVzQ5dVpXMFdoNFU/edit?usp=sharing
	Research how to use a third-party library called json-lib (http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/257-how-to-parse-json-in-java/) so that
	you can parse the contents of sample_data.json and print out a list of trending events like so:
	
	1. #GanaPuntosSi
	2. #WordsThatDescribeMe
	3. #10PersonasQueExtra\u00f1oMucho
	4. Apple $1.5
	5. Zelko
	6. LWWY
	7. Lance Armstrong
	8. Gonzo
	9. Premium Rush
	10. Sweet Dreams
13. Write a program that uses the Twitter REST API to list the top trending topics in available locations.
	The UI of the program should first list available locations in a numbered list, like so:
	
	1. LA
	2. SF
	3 ...
	
	Enter location id: _
	
	After the user has choosen the location, list the trending topics in that location, also in a numbered list.
